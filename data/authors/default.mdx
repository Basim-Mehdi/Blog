My name is Basim Mehdi. I’m a Cyber Security student at Air University, still trying to figure out where I’m headed. I’ve failed many times, and I’m still failing, but I keep going.

I’m learning Web Exploitation, Digital Forensics, Binary Exploitation, and AI/ML. I don’t know if I’ll ever find my purpose, but even if I don’t, I’ll find myself along the way.
